# Project 3: Structure Analysis of AlphaFold
This project explores the capabilities and accuracy of Google's DeepMind AI program, **AlphaFold**, in predicting 3D protein structures. The analysis focuses on comparing AlphaFold-generated models against "gold standard" structures obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The core of this project is the evaluation of AlphaFold's performance on two distinct protein sequences, using the **Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)** as a key metric for structural similarity.

## Background

Proteins are fundamental to virtually all biological processes, and their specific 3D structure dictates their function.Understanding these structures is crucial for advancements in drug design, disease treatment, and protein engineering. While determining protein structures experimentally can be time-consuming, computational tools like AlphaFold offer a powerful alternative for rapid and accurate predictions.

## Analysis Overview

The project analyzes two protein sequences to test AlphaFold's accuracy under different conditions.

### Sequence 1: Fimbrial Adhesion Protein (PDB ID: 6Y4F)

**Origin**: From the gram-negative bacteria *Proteus mirabilis*, known for its role in catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
**Characteristics**: A longer sequence of approximately 130 amino acids.
**Results**: AlphaFold generated highly accurate models for this protein. The RMSD scores, which measure the average distance between atoms of the predicted and the actual structures, were very low (ranging from **0.498 to 0.620**).This indicates a high degree of similarity to the gold standard, demonstrating AlphaFold's effectiveness on this sequence.

### Sequence 2: CST Complex Subunit (PDB ID: 6W6W)

**Origin**: A human protein that is part of the CST complex, essential for protecting the ends of chromosomes (telomeres).
***Characteristics**: A much shorter sequence of about 40 amino acids and a component of a larger protein complex.
**Results**: The predictions for this sequence were significantly less accurate.The RMSD scores were substantially higher (all above **12.0**), suggesting a notable divergence between the generated models and the experimentally determined structure.

## Key Conclusions

**AlphaFold is a powerful tool**: It can generate highly accurate protein structure models, which can serve as a valuable starting point for scientific research.
**Accuracy can vary**: The accuracy of AlphaFold's predictions can be influenced by factors such as the length of the amino acid sequence and whether the protein is part of a larger complex. The model was more accurate for the longer, standalone protein than for the shorter, complex-associated one.
**Limitations of RMSD**: While useful, RMSD values are most effective for comparing very similar structures and can be less informative when comparing two different structures.
**Protein Dynamics**: The report acknowledges that current AI models like AlphaFold primarily predict static structures and do not yet fully capture the dynamic nature of proteins, which constantly change based on their environment and interactions.

Overall, this project highlights both the remarkable capabilities and the current limitations of AI in structural biology.
