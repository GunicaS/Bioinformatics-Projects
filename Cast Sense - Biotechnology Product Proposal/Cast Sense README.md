# Cast Sense

### Revolutionizing Fracture Care by Detecting Infections Early

Cast Sense is a wearable biosensor system designed to be integrated with traditional orthopedic casts. It provides real-time monitoring for bacterial infections, allowing for early intervention and improved patient outcomes. This project goes over our findings and proposal for our biosense system.

## The Problem with Traditional Casts

Millions of bone fractures occur every year, with many requiring casts for healing. However, the warm, moist environment under a cast is an ideal breeding ground for bacteria.
* Traditional casts are prone to bacterial contamination, which can lead to severe infections.
* Infections from bacteria like *Acinetobacter baumannii* can have a crude mortality rate as high as 20-80%.
* These infections lead to serious complications, prolong recovery times, and significantly increase healthcare costs.

## Our Solution: The Cast Sense System

Cast Sense directly addresses this problem with an innovative biosensor that detects the presence of specific pathogenic bacteria.

### How It Works
1.  **Detection:** A specialized biosensor with two distinct nodes is placed inside the cast, near the skin. Each node is designed to detect a common opportunistic bacterium: ***S. epidermidis*** and ***A. baumannii***.
2.  **Signal Processing:** When bacteria are present, the nodes generate an electrical signal. This signal is sent to a small, external processor connected to the sensor.
3.  **Alerts:** The processor amplifies and analyzes the data, then sends the results wirelessly via Bluetooth to a dedicated application on the user's smartphone, providing an immediate alert if an infection is detected.

### Key Technology
Our biosensor utilizes two different detection methods for high accuracy:
* ***S. epidermidis* Node:** This node uses an **MgZnO protein tag** designed to bind specifically to the *lysostaphin enzyme*, a unique biomarker produced by *S. epidermidis*.
* ***A. baumannii* Node:** This node features a **gold-tipped electrode coated in a polymeric film**. It detects a pH interaction caused by the *1,3-DAP monomer* present in *A. baumannii*, registering a voltage change to confirm its presence.

## Market Opportunity

The market for wearable medical devices is growing rapidly, with the wearable biosensor market projected to reach **$65.4 billion by 2033**.

* **Target Customers:** Our primary customers are **hospitals and orthopedic doctors** who can integrate Cast Sense into their fracture treatment protocol. We aim for insurance companies to cover the device as a form of preventative care.
* **Competitive Advantage:** The market for direct bacterial detection in casts is currently **undersaturated**. Our main competitor, **CastMinder**, only evaluates conditions that *increase the likelihood* of infection (like pressure and moisture) but does not directly detect the presence of bacteria.

## Intellectual Property & Regulatory Pathway

While the biosensor field has many active patents, Cast Sense establishes a unique position through its specific combination of components, detection modes, and application.

* **IP Strategy:** Our unique use of an antibody tag and a specialized polymeric film for dual-bacterial detection in a wearable format provides a strong basis for a new patent.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** The device will be subject to approval from the **FDA**'s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), requiring clinical trials and proper labeling. Manufacturing processes will adhere to **EPA** guidelines for electronic products.
